This repository is used to store all of my settings in softwares/apps that I use. Each folder will contain settings files. If you like my configuration of any software, feel free to download and apply it to yours
And by the way, if you know how to version control files in multiple directories, please tell me. I hate copying files over and over again. Thanks!
